CHARACTERS:
-THIEF: If the thief is played, two cards more than the number of players need to be played. After each player receives a card,
	the two cards are put in the center of the table. The thief can, if he/she/they want to, during the first night, exchange
	his cards with one of those cards that he will play until the end of the game. If the two cards are werewolf, the thief has
	to take one of the two werewolf cards, until the end of the game.
-CUPID: The first night, Cupid chooses 2 players and make them fall in love, then becomes a villager. 
	If one dies, the other dies too. A lover can't vote against the other lover. If the lovers are a villager and a werewolf,
	their objective changes; they must eliminate all the players except them.
-WEREWOLVES: Each night, the werewolves pick 1 player to kill.
-LITTLE GIRL: The little girl can secretly look at the werewolves during their turn. If she is caught in the act, she dies instead of the victim.
	(Not implemented since she would be hard to balance or implement in the way the game will be played in discord)
-WITCH: She has two potions: one to save the werewolves's victim, one to eliminate a player. She can only use each potion once during the game. 
-ORACLE: Each night, they can discover the real identity of a player. They must help the other villagers but discreetly to not be found by werewolves.
-HUNTER: If they are killed by werewolves or eliminated by vote, they must immediately kill another player of their choice.
-VILLAGERS: They don't have any special power except thinking and the right to vote.
-CAPTAIN: This card is given to a player besides their card. They are elected by a vote. This player's vote counts for two instead of one.
-IDIOT: If he is chosen by the village to be eliminated, he stays alive, but he cannot vote anymore.
-ANCIENT: He can resist the first werewolf's attack, but if he is killed by the witch, the huntsman, or the villagers, the villagers lose their powers.
-SCAPEGOAT: If the village can't agree about whom to eliminate, the scapegoat is eliminated. Nevertheless, he can decide about who can vote the next day.
-GUARD: Each night, he can protect a player from being attack by the werewolves. He can protect himself, but he can't protect the same player two consecutive nights.
-PIED PIPER: His objective is to charm all the players alive except him (he can't charm himself). Each night, he can charm two players that wake up 
and recognise with those of the nights before. IF all players are charmed he wins.

DISTRIBUTION:
-WEREWOLVES: 1 (<8), 2 (8-11), 3 (>11)
-VILLAGERS: same number as werewolves
-SPECIAL VILLAGERS: 1 of each.

ROUNDS:
The bot gives each player a role and procedes through the rounds on 2 stages: DAY and NIGHT.
	During DAY the last night's actions are revealed, everyone can talk to eachother and vote together someone to get killed.
	During NIGHT, each player enforces its role when asked by the bot.
DAY interactions with the bot are public. NIGHT intereactions are private via DM.

TURNS:
	1st Night Only
		-Thief
		-Cupid
		-Lovers
	Every night
		-Werewolves
		-Little Girl
		-Seer
		-Witch

GOALS:
the werewolves: their goal is to kill all the special villagers and all the normal villagers.
the villagers: their goal is to kill all the werewolves.
